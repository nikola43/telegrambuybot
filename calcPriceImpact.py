    This calculation uses the constant product formula used on Uniswap to determine how much of one asset should be swapped for another asset.
    Some exchanges may have a slightly more complex formula to combat price impact or impermanent loss.
    But this is the most common and easiest to calculate.

    Constant product formula: token_a_pool_size * token_b_pool_size = constant_product
    constant_product will be the same number before and after a trade occurs.

    A couple of examples to show price impact calculation:

    Starting pool for both examples

    Initial pool info

    wMATIC = 3024
    LUCHA = 4318
    Constant Product = 13,057,632
    Lucha Market Price = 0,700322422 wMATIC
    First example : 100 wMATIC for LUCHA

    After swap

    wMATIC = 3124 (we added 100 wMATIC to the pool)
    Constant Product = 13,057,632 (stays the same)
    LUCHA = 4179,77977 (constant product / new wMATIC amount)
    LUCHA received = 138,22023 (old LUCHA amount â€” new LUCHA amount)
    Price paid per LUCHA= 0,72334830965 wMATIC
    Price impact =1- (Market price / Price paid) = 3,18%  """
